# Overview

This repository establishes a modular foundation for a Backstage-based platform that supports distinct platform-engineering personas (e.g., “IT Engineer”, “Platform Engineer”, “Developer”). Based on role-based access control (RBAC), users are presented with only the environments and services they’re permitted to access.

**Important Notices:**  
- **Under Development:** This environment is currently under active development.  
- **Not Actively Supported:** It is **not** an actively supported or production-ready platform.  
- **README Will Be Updated:** This README is a living document and will be updated as implementation progresses.

### Repository Structure

| Directory           | Purpose in Persona & RBAC Context |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| `catalog-entities` | Defines core Backstage entities—services, APIs, tools—organized per persona or environment. |
| `catalog-info`     | Enriches entities with metadata, such as persona tags or access levels, to support RBAC filtering. |
| `groups`           | Maps users or roles to logical groups (e.g., “Frontend Team”), aiding policy enforcement and UI segmentation. |
| `storage`          | Persists access rules, persona mappings, or configuration data necessary for runtime RBAC enforcement. |
| `system`           | Houses shared services like authentication, authorization workflows, and configuration management logic. |

### How This Supports Personas with RBAC

- **Persona Definitions:** Each persona is represented by specific entity definitions in `catalog-entities`, enhanced by metadata from `catalog-info` to reflect access permissions.
- **Group Mapping:** The `groups` directory enables mapping of users or teams to persona roles, simplifying access scoping.
- **Dynamic Enforcement:** The `storage` directory supports dynamic loading of access policies and persona assignments.
- **Central Services:** The `system` directory provides centralized services—such as identity management and permission enforcement—for the platform.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository into your Backstage environment.  
2. Review directory structure and align each with your platform’s plugin or configuration architecture.  
3. Define personas and their access profiles:  
   - Use `catalog-entities` and `catalog-info` to define and tag persona-specific services.  
   - Map users or teams to personas via `groups`.  
   - Store RBAC logic and mappings in `storage`.  
   - Leverage shared utilities in `system` to integrate RBAC enforcement.  
4. Integrate with your identity provider (e.g., SSO, OAuth) to enforce access control based on persona metadata at runtime.

### Contribution & Evolution

- Internal contributors: Follow Dell’s internal repository guidelines.  
- When adding or modifying, please document any persona/RBAC configurations or logic.  
- As the project evolves, update this README with:
  - A more detailed project purpose or overview  
  - Implementation examples or setup walkthroughs  
  - Architectural diagrams showing the interaction between personas, catalog entities, groups, storage, and system components

### Limitations & Next Steps

This version reflects intended architecture based on current repository structure—since the implementation is still being developed, certain details are subject to change. To improve clarity and usefulness, consider:

- Adding example files or code in each directory showing how RBAC and persona logic is applied  
- Defining persona profiles, role mappings, or access policy examples  
- Including architectural flow diagrams illustrating identity, metadata tagging, and access flows between components

This README will evolve alongside the implementation. When more details are available, I’d be happy to help enhance it further.
